# machines
This repo is built to house machines, including finite state machines. <br/>

So far i have only added one machine to this public repo. More to come. <br/>

## ndfsm
Please note that ndfsm.py is just a script and is not yet PEP8 compliant, so you may have to navigate the code without a lot of commentary help. <br/>

The script runs a non-deterministic finite state machine creator that corresponds to the included diagram. <br/>
The script is experimental and as such was deliberately 'waterlogged' (heavily logged using logger). It also makes an obnoxious use of accessing globals() listings. <br/>

The side benefit of being waterlogged is that the logging will walk you thru every little thing that is happening. All you have to do is just open the directory and run 'python ndfsm.py' and the terminal will spit out the results for you.
